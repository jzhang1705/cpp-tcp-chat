Your code will mostly work as a basic multi-client chat server, but there are a few issues and potential pitfalls you should fix before running it.

---

### 1. **Locking problem when calling `get_client_name`**

Right now you call:

```cpp
{
    std::scoped_lock lock(clients_mutex);
    get_client_name(client_fd);
}
```

But `get_client_name` itself **also** locks `clients_mutex`.
This means you’ll deadlock immediately because `std::mutex` is not recursive.

**Fix:** Don’t lock outside the call to `get_client_name`, since it already locks internally.

```cpp
get_client_name(client_fd);
```

---

### 2. **Broadcasting and mutex scope**

In `handle_client` you do:

```cpp
std::scoped_lock lock(clients_mutex);
std::cout << message.c_str() << '\n';
for (auto [other_fd, name] : clients) {
    if (other_fd != client_fd) {
        send(other_fd, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0);
    }
}
```

This works, but you’re **holding the mutex** during `send()` calls.
If a client’s TCP buffer is full, `send()` will block and prevent other threads from updating `clients`.

**Better:**

* Copy the list of target sockets while holding the lock
* Release the lock before sending

```cpp
std::vector<int> targets;
{
    std::scoped_lock lock(clients_mutex);
    std::cout << message << '\n';
    for (auto& [other_fd, name] : clients) {
        if (other_fd != client_fd) {
            targets.push_back(other_fd);
        }
    }
}
for (int fd : targets) {
    send(fd, message.c_str(), message.size(), 0);
}
```

---

### 3. **Missing `SO_REUSEADDR`**

If the server crashes and you restart it quickly, `bind()` might fail with `"Address already in use"`.
You should add this before `bind()`:

```cpp
int opt = 1;
setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &opt, sizeof(opt));
```

---

### 4. **Null-terminator risk**

You do:

```cpp
buffer[bytes] = '\0';
```

That’s fine **only if** `bytes < sizeof(buffer)` (which is true for `recv()` but good to remember in case you change buffer logic later).

---

### 5. **Race condition on client disconnect**

If `recv()` returns `<= 0` in `handle_client`, you do:

```cpp
std::cerr << clients[client_fd] << " disconnected\n";
close(client_fd);
std::scoped_lock lock(clients_mutex);
clients.erase(client_fd);
```

But here, you access `clients[client_fd]` **without holding the mutex**.
You should lock before reading from `clients`.

---

### 6. **Thread safety for printing**

`std::cout` is not thread-safe for interleaved lines — two threads printing at the same time can mix output.
You could either:

* Lock around `std::cout`
* Or use a dedicated logging thread

---

### Fixed `accept` loop

Here’s your main loop with the locking fix:

```cpp
while (true) {
    sockaddr_in client_addr;
    socklen_t client_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    int client_fd = accept(server_fd, reinterpret_cast<sockaddr*>(&client_addr), &client_len);
    if (client_fd < 0) {
        perror("accept");
        continue;
    }

    get_client_name(client_fd);
    std::thread(handle_client, client_fd).detach();
}
```

---

If you want, I can rewrite the whole file for you so it’s **deadlock-proof**, **safe for multiple clients**, and **avoids blocking on sends**. That would make it production-ready for a small chat server.

Do you want me to do that?
